The Anchorage Pioneer Home South five story structure was built in 1975 as what is now identified as a Type I-B Structure with an R-2 Occupancy (Residential Living). Over the past 44 years the individuals who live in the building have slowly evolved from individuals who were able to fully care for themselves to individuals who need some level of custodial care, which is not in alignment with the Residential (R-2) Occupancy designation. This designation falls short of the facility’s actual use as an assisted living home, serving a particularly vulnerable and less-than-able-bodied population.																																																																																				
	In FY2019, the division received capital funding that allowed for the development of a small unit on the fourth floor for those with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD) and complex behaviors. As part of that renovation, the Pioneer Home upgraded safety features and was successful in correcting the zoning designation of this floor. The Home now seeks to upgrade the safety of the remainder of the facility to assisted living home standards.		X																2080000

Snowmobiling is one of Alaska’s fastest growing outdoor activities and a very important transportation resource for rural communities. There is a growing demand to develop and maintain trails and trailheads to provide for safe riding opportunities and transportation routes, and to educate riders about safe riding practices. Funds for this program are provided by snowmobile registration fees paid by Alaskans and are distributed in the form of grants for trail development and maintenance, trail marking and signing, and safety education.
