This project reduces the cost of energy by reducing or eliminating fuel loss from leaks, spills, or catastrophic failure. By providing enough capacity for current and planned needs, communities may purchase fuel in larger quantities at a lower cost per gallon. Projects ensure facilities meet code compliance standards improving life, health, and safety of the community. 	Declining funds available for bulk fuel upgrades in rural Alaska means that bulk fuel tanks are not upgraded timely. As a result, communities are left with aging fuel tanks that may not meet the capacity needs of the community or are at risk of leaks, contamination, and/or failure.

These ROW parcels can be used in lieu of state matching funds on a federally funded project. It is also allowable that match funds be used for correcting off-system bridges. When the state performs work on improving bridges with non-federal funds, the value of this work can be credited as required match toward federally funded bridge work.

The State of Alaska excels in marketing tourism and seafood but has a limited market presence in other key industries such as minerals, forest products, and transportation logistics.	In FY2024, DCCED will implement a multi-faceted, multi-agency marketing initiative focused on the opportunity for responsible and sustainable development of Alaska’s natural resources. This effort will include strategies for all existing businesses, development of Alaska’s resources, mariculture, and food-security related sectors. The initiative will increase demand for Alaskan products and services while promoting existing efforts to grow Alaska’s economy.		X				5000000
