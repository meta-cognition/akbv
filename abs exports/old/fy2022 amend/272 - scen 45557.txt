This access site is an important entry point for users to both the Glennallen subsistence fishery and the Chitina dipnet fishery on the Copper River. Trespassing and parking issues have been contentious for a number of years at this access point and have required a number of multi-agency meetings to resolve.			X						165000

Parking at the existing Eagle Rock facility is very limited compared to the demand and overflows into a ditch line at the other side of the Kenai Spur Highway causing boaters to run across the busy highway. This project will remedy those two major issues by (1) constructing a 60-stall parking facility at the Bookey Parcel, suitable for truck with trailer design vehicle, and (2) constructing an access road directly off of Kenai Spur Highway, through the Bookey Parcel, and into Eagle Rock, completely bypassing the residential neighborhood.

When the state performs work on improving bridges with non-federal funds, the value of this work can be credited as required match toward federally-funded bridge work.
