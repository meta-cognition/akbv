This project reduces the cost of energy by reducing or eliminating fuel loss from leaks, spills or catastrophic failure. By providing enough capacity for current and planned needs, communities may purchase fuel in larger quantities at a lower cost per gallon. Projects meet code compliance standards improving life, health, and safety of the community. This program includes more than the replacement of entire facilities; the program also emphasizes maintenance and improvement projects and training for operations and planned maintenance.	Declining funds available for bulk fuel upgrades in rural Alaska means that bulk fuel tanks are not upgraded timely. As a result, communities are left with aging fuel tanks that may not meet the capacity needs of the community or are at risk of leaks, contamination, and/or failure. Recent emphasis has also been put on barge header projects to protect river and ocean side fuel systems.  		X	7500000																		5500000			0

The purpose of the study was to identify options for an optimal access corridor to a broader, district-wide area of resources with connection to Port MacKenzie. 	The proposed route is approximately 100 miles long, from the west end of Ayrshire Road to near the confluence of the Talachulitna and Skwentna Rivers. After crossing the Skwentna River, it would continue adjacent to the proposed Donlin Gold gas pipeline route on the north side of the Skwentna River. Near the Happy River crossing, the route would diverge away from the Donlin Gold gas pipeline route and continue west to a point of tie-in with existing mineral exploration roads.

Building roads and bringing in utilities to quality state lands will stimulate growth and help make large-scale farming successful, which will in turn grow Alaska’s economy. This initial investment will provide the structure for continued, sustainable agriculture and mariculture that will create new jobs and opportunities for businesses and entrepreneurs, a sustainable way of life for farming families, and address food security in Alaska.
