Per AS 42.45.085 (B) up to $25 million of Power Cost Equalization funds may be appropriated to the Renewable Energy Fund (REF), to the bulk fuel revolving loan fund, or for RPSU, or to a combination of the funds or purposes listed. This project includes federal receipts and state match for those funds, as well as $10,000,000 of excess earnings from the PCE Fund that will be directed towards deferred maintenance projects.

These ROW parcels can be used in lieu of the State matching funds on a federally-funded project. It is also allowable that match funds be used for correcting off-system bridges. When the State performs work on improving bridges with non-federal funds, the value of this work can be credited as required match toward federally-funded bridge work.

In partnership with DOT, DOA, and DMVA, the court system has advocated for funding for the deferred maintenance in the facilities that the court occupies. Funding is requested to continue the ongoing effort to manage the backlog of deferred maintenance projects.	The court system requests deferred maintenance funding for repairs to building components that have not been sufficiently maintained and whose condition now threatens longevity of the buildings. This request for $15.3 million will address all known backlog of deferred maintenance.		X																						3820000

The Mariculture Revolving Loan Fund (MRLF) was established to provide patient capital, but additional financial assistance is necessary to support the industry during its infancy.

"SFCS1 removed project 4/11: http://www.legfin.state.ak.us/BudgetReports/LY2022/Capital/SenateFinanceCS1/CapitalProjectDetailByAgency.pdf

The State has two existing revolving loan programs, the Mariculture Revolving Loan Fund (MRLF) and the Agriculture Revolving Loan Fund (ARLF). Both funds can provide loans to mariculture farmers. Giving both programs the ability to grant funds would allow more flexibility within this growing mariculture industry and encourage development.
